I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Manchester, expected to graduate in later 2024. I received my M.S. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech in 2021 and my B.S. in Electronic Information Science and Technology from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2019.

My research interests lie in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge graphs, and information retrieval. Specifically, I recently focus on large language model finetuning and benchmarking, temporal reasoning, and knowledge graph reasoning with applications in finance, biology, medicine, and NLP.

I have published conference papers on EMNLP, BigData, BioNLP in ACL, etc and served as a reviewer in ACL, PAKDD, Information Sciences, Information Process & Management. I received a Kilburn Computer Science Department Scholarship from the University of Manchester. I previously won awards including the Outstanding Graduate Student Award and Exchange Student Award at UESTC.
